Implementation of ASN.1 parsing in swift. Please note that I will only
implement functionality that I require for other upstream projects. I decided
to opensource this codebase mainly in the hopes of providing a decent starting
point for others. Feel free to extend this package using pull requests. Maybe
this will turn into a fully fledged ASN.1 parser through community effort ;)
